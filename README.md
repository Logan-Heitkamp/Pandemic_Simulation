# Pandemic_Simulation
Welcome to my Pandemic Simulation project. This prject was heavily inspired by a Three Blue One Brown video where he makes a very similar simulation. The simulation is intended to visualize the curve that is often mentioned durring the Covid-19 pandemic of the number of people who are sick over a time period. The project is intened to be ran through the simulation_gui.py file where you can edit the settings of the simulation before running it.

The project is made entirely in Python. The gui uses tkinter and the main simulation uses pygame for the visuals. I also created my own version of a quadtree data structure to increase the speed of the simulation.
