# Pandemic Simulation

**project description**
This project was createed to visualize the curve that was often mentioned durring the Covid-19 pandemic of the number of people who are effected over time. By changin the settigns of the simulation, you can see what inputs effect how quickly the pandemic spreads.

**How it was made**
This project was writen entirely in Python and uses the packages bellow
- Tkinter (Used for the settings GUI)
- Pygame (Used for simulation visuals)
- numpy (Used for the numpy.random.choice() function)
- Pytest (Used to write tests for the project)

**Setup**
If you want to run the project on your own device, follow the instructions bellow:
1. Download the code from the repo.
2. Setup a virtual environment and name it "Pandemic_Simulation".
3. Download all required packacges in the requirements.txt file.
4. Run the project through the simulation_gui.py file. This should pop up a window that looks like this:

5. Here you can edit the settings of the simulation as well as saving and loading settings you have used previously.
6. Once you are ready to run the simulation, press the green "Start Simulation" button in the bottom right.
7. The simulation should start and look somthing like this:

8. After closing the simulation window, you can run the simulation to see if anything changes or change the settings to explore more possibilities.
